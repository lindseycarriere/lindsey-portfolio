    With over 20 years of experience and multiple AWS certifications, I specialize in the design and delivery of scalable, cloud-native ecosystems. I thrive at the intersection of executive strategy and technical execution, having led global engineering teams through complex on-premises to cloud migrations and microservice modernizations. My focus is on building secure, performant, and observable systems using AI-augmented development workflows to accelerate delivery without sacrificing quality.

    Beyond the architecture and code, I am a hands-on mentor dedicated to fostering growth mindsets and building high-performing teams. Whether I'm refining technical epics, optimizing CI/CD pipelines, or contributing to patent-pending innovations, my goal is to deliver incremental value through well-architected patterns.
